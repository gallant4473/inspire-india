						<h3>Rules & Regulations</h3><br>
						<h3 style="font-size:20px;"><i>(The guiding principles will dictate decision making by the Race Committee on any issue not specifically covered in these rules)
						</i></h3><br>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">1. GENERAL</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								All participants are responsible for reading and understanding the rules, event information and instructions given before and during the event.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								 Standard RAAM Style Event Rules apply (copied below), with exceptions detailed at the bottom.

								Safety is a primary concern. In an emergency, riders and their crews are expected to help, and will be given credit for any lost time, if necessary.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								All rules and regulations must be obeyed by all riders and support crew members at all times.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								 <a href="http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/userfiles/file/19_2015%20RAAM%20FINAL%20Race%20Rules%205-15-15.pdf" target="_blank">RAAM RULES</a> (hyperlinked for your perusal) may be referred to in the event that a situation is not covered in these rules. The race committee has the authority to override, modify or create rules based on extenuating circumstances.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">2. CONDUCT</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Riders and support crew members must conduct themselves in a civil manner at all times during the race.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Riders and support crew members may not act maliciously toward any other person for any reason. Riders and support crew members may not intentionally impede the progress of or misdirect any other person for any reason.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Riders and support crew must at all times behave respectfully toward all Race officials and volunteers.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Violation of the conduct rules and/or any other inappropriate behaviour by a rider or support crew member will result in the rider’s immediate disqualification and possible suspension from future Inspire India events. This may include the suspension of crew members, from participation or supporting any Inspire India Races. 
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">3. TRAFFIC LAWS</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Riders, follow vehicles and support crew members must obey traffic laws at all times.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								This includes, but is not limited to: driving on the correct side of the road, stopping and waiting at red lights until they turn green, stopping at stop signs and checking for traffic before proceeding, using hand signals for all turns, keeping as far to the left as safety permits, using the shoulder whenever possible and obeying speed limits.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">4. DRAFTING</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Drafting is not allowed in any category, except for teams (see rule # 9). Riders must maintain at least a 10 meter space cushion between each other and vehicles. When passing, riders may encroach on the 10 meter space cushion as necessary, but if they linger, they will be considered to be drafting. Drafting any motor vehicle is not allowed.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Any violation of the drafting rules will result in a rider’s immediate disqualification. 
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">5. MECHANICAL SUPPORT</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								All riders should be self-sufficient and properly equipped. Riders and/or their support crew should have everything necessary to repair or adjust the rider’s bicycle and combat the elements. Race officials may help, but take no responsibility or make any guarantees to fix mechanical problems when and where they occur.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Riders and support crew members are encouraged to assist one another with mechanical or other problems, but no time credit will be given unless it is an emergency or extenuating situation.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">6. BICYCLES</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								All bicycles must be propelled solely by human force. There is no limit as to the number of bicycles a rider may use. Disc wheels, wheel covers and/or aero bars are allowed
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								There are no bicycle categories at this time. Special bikes will be considered and ruled upon by the Race Director.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								All bicycles must be deemed to be in race condition. If a bicycle is judged to be unfit or unsafe to ride, riders may NOT use it until the issue is resolved to the satisfaction of the Race Director.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">7. HELMETS</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Riders must wear an approved helmet, properly fastened, at all times when riding a bicycle.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">8. LIGHTS & REFLECTIVE GEAR</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Riders must use at least one steady white front light visible from 500’ (150 lumens or more) mounted to the bicycle and a steady (not flashing) red rear light visible from 300’ mounted to the bicycle. A second red rear light visible from 300’ mounted to the bicycle or rider, may be kept on flashing or steady mode. Be warned however that the flashing mode can cause extreme irritation and/or hypnotic effect on the follow car driver.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Riders must wear a reflective gear during the night hours, in the form of a vest or bandoleer. (Adhesive reflective material and jerseys with reflective material stitched to them, are not acceptable in lieu of reflective gear) 
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Lights and reflective gear must be used during night hours from 6:00 PM – 7:00 AM, and switched on when passing through a tunnel. All lighting requirements must be met by all riders, during the night hours (mandatory direct follow hours). Any rider caught riding without lights and/or reflective gear during the night hours will be immediately penalized (no warnings) Ref 18A-18E.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								These are the minimal requirements we will accept, but are nowhere near optimal. For optimal lighting, we recommend using a front light of at least 600 lumens, with a secondary front light in use with the other light or to use as a backup. For the rear, we recommend using lights with visibility up to 500'.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support crew must wear Reflective gear during the night hours. It is recommended that they wear reflective gear during daylight hours when they are outside the vehicle during daylight hours as well.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">9. TEAMS</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Teams may be comprised of 2 - 4 members. The same rules and regulations that apply to individual riders, apply to teams and their support crews.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Rider exchanges may take place anywhere on the course and at any frequency depending on team strategy. Any number of teammates may ride at the same time. A team’s official time is calculated when the first rider crosses the finish line.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Drafting is allowed between teammates, but not between rival teams, solo racers or any other rider.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Each Team must have a team leader, who should be a member of the team. Any decision regarding penalties or disqualification will be conveyed to the team leader or the crew chief.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Team members may support their team when they are not riding, but must obey all rules regarding support crew members, with the exception of the rule banning support crew members from riding on the course (13.E).
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">10. SLEEP</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Sleep is not mandatory, but is recommended that when a rider (or support crew member) need it, they take at least a short power nap.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Race officials reserve the right to pull a rider and/or support crew member off the course and order them to rest if that person is suffering from sleep deprivation and/or riding/driving or acting in an unsafe manner.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">11. ROUTE</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								All riders and teams must ride (or walk with their bicycle) every inch of the route.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								The route is not marked, but is easy to follow with the cue sheets that you will be provided. No credit will be given for navigational errors or for leaving the course. 
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								If for any reason racers are forced off route by road construction, diversion due to accidents or by traffic police for any reason, crew must immediately contact one of the Race Officials and report exact details of diversion. Racers may continue to race. If for any reason they are unable to establish a telephone call, they must send a text/WhatsApp message, giving co-ordinates or location pin of start of diversion. They must do the same at the time of re-joining the race route.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Race Committee will asses whether a time penalty is to be added to Racer/Team time or whether a time deduction is required. This decision will be conveyed to the crew so that they can re-calculate race cut-off time for the racer/team.CHECKPOINTS
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">12. CHECKPOINTS</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								At a manned checkpoint, Riders or crew must report their arrival with the Race Card to the official when they arrive, and sign the checkpoint log. Time will be recorded as of when they report, not when they arrive, if there is a lapse. At an unmanned checkpoint Riders or crew must report their arrival in the manner prescribed.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support crew can report instead of the rider during daylight hours. Rider may continue riding, except at the finish of their event, at which time the rider must check in. At night it is mandatory for the racer to stop until the checkpoint procedure is completed.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								It is solely the rider’s and crews responsibility to make sure their time is recorded, when they pass through a manned checkpoint. Failure to do so will result in penalties and/or disqualification. The support crew may not report before a rider has physically crossed that particular time control.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Riders may not be eligible for Finishers awards if they reach a manned checkpoint after it has closed and officials have departed. Participants may continue riding the course but their timings will not be validated.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">13. SUPPORT CREWS</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Support vehicle with a minimum of 2 support crew capable of driving the vehicle, for solo riders is Mandatory. For safety it is advised that there be 3 crew in the vehicle. 3 and 4 person Teams may manage with a single support crew member who is the dedicated driver, provided team members (riders) are prepared to share the driving. 2 Persons teams are required to have 2 crew that can both drive.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support vehicles may leap frog their rider during the day and provide support only via pedestrian hand offs. No vehicle hand offs are allowed. At night, they must follow directly behind their rider at all times. It is mandatory for the Racer to be within the headlights of the support vehicle during night time hours.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support crew members must obey all of the rules and regulations. If a support crew member violates a rule, it will result in their expulsion from the race and penalties and/or disqualification for their rider.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support crew members must be considerate of the surrounding area in which the course travels. They should not behave in a disruptive manner.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support crew members are not allowed to ride a bicycle on the course at any time during the race. 
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">14. SUPPORT VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Any 4 wheeled vehicle may be used as support vehicle. Please ensure that it is well maintained and in proper condition before start of race.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Rear emergency flashers (Parking lights/Hazard lights) must be used while supporting a rider, driving slowly or whenever pulled over.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								All support vehicles must display a “SLOW-MOVING VEHICLE TRIANGLE”. “Slow-moving vehicle triangles” may be purchased at most auto parts or hardware stores. In the absence of a “Slow-moving vehicle triangle”, the support vehicle must prominently display, a reflective sticker not less than 2 feet in length. 
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support vehicle with a Bike rack mounted at rear must use a rear red flashing light mounted on the bike rack.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support vehicle must display Race signage in the manner instructed at time of briefing. Race signage may not be removed for the entire duration of the race, except if the rider/s drop out of the race or are disqualified.
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">15. FOLLOWING THE RIDER/HAND-OFF’S/PASSING</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Support crews may leap frog their rider during the day and provide support via pedestrian hand off’s, and at night, they must follow directly behind their rider.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Follow vehicles must stay as far to the left as safety permits while driving behind their rider. If the shoulder is wide enough for the vehicle to use, they must use it. If it’s not, they must drive as close to the left edge of the pavement as possible.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Support vehicles must halt off the shoulder line whenever possible.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Follow vehicles should never block traffic to the rear. If traffic builds up behind them, they must pull off the road and allow it to pass. Then, when it is clear, they may continue to follow their rider. If there is a lot of traffic, or if the road is narrow, follow vehicles must pull over and leapfrog their rider. Except at night, when the racer must also pull over and allow traffic to clear.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Follow vehicles may not impede the progress of another rider or their follow vehicle.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								When a rider with a follow vehicle passes another rider, use this procedure: rider A passes rider B and gets clear. When a gap of 30 meters forms between the two riders, rider A’s follow vehicle may pass rider B (and their follow vehicle) and continue to follow their rider. Rider B (and their follow vehicle) may not impede the progress of rider A or their follow vehicle.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								It is strongly recommended that support crew follow their riders closely, but at a safe distance during the night. It is mandatory to keep them in their headlights at all times. This will provide protection and light to their rider.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Riders may not be pushed, pulled, towed or otherwise assisted by their follow vehicle. This will result in immediate disqualification.
							</h5></li>
							<li><h5>
								Make sure that crew and the racer plan ahead and refuel and restock before 6:00pm to avoid wasting the race time at night. Make certain you have enough supplies and fuel to make it through the entire night before 11 PM. On some parts of the route, it will be impossible to find food or fuel after that. 
							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">16. QUALIFYING FOR RAAM</h4>

							</h5></li>
						</ol>
						<h4 style="color:#ff0000;">18. WARNINGS/PENALTIES</h4>
						<ol type="A">
							<li><h5>
								Riders and support crew members must obey all rules and regulations at all times. There will be no exceptions. It is the rider’s responsibility to ensure and s/he or her/his support crew do not give any cause for doubt.
